## 🎯 Value Proposition

**VendorBridge** is a modern, enterprise-ready **AI-Powered Vendor Management & Procurement SaaS Platform** that bridges the communication and operational gap between corporate procurement officers, internal financial/department managers, and third-party vendors. By automating manual Request for Quotation (RFQ) cycles, tracking compliance metrics, performing intelligent bid evaluations, and routing multi-step purchase order approvals, VendorBridge accelerates corporate procurement while ensuring absolute transparency and compliance.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Modern enterprise procurement is heavily bottlenecked by legacy systems, offline communication channels, and administrative friction:
* 📉 **Frictional Communication:** Procurement officers spend hours manually emailing spreadsheets, specs, and deadlines to vendors, resulting in scattered threads and lost bids.
* 🛡️ **Zero Audit Compliance:** Bidding processes occur offline, making the evaluation opaque, exposing organizations to compliance flags, and complicating audit trails.
* ⏱️ **Delayed Purchase Approvals:** Internal approval chains for purchase orders rely on verbal sign-offs or manual email routing, stalling production and delivery.
* 📂 **High Administrative Overhead:** Manually verifying supplier registration, calculating trust scores, and manually matching incoming invoices against purchase orders creates immense administrative lag.

---

## 💡 The Solution

VendorBridge solves these problems through a single, secure, decoupled SaaS platform designed for high-throughput procurement operations:
* 🤝 **Unified Collaboration Portal:** Vendors self-register, onboard via interactive steps, and submit detailed digital quotations directly against active RFQs.
* 📊 **Smart Side-by-Side Bidding Evaluations:** Procurement officers compare vendor bids in real-time on price, delivery lead times, and overall trust score.
* ⚡ **Automated Multi-Step Approval Workflows:** System automatically routes purchase orders to managers based on value thresholds, recording cryptographic audit histories.
* 🎯 **Dynamic Dashboards:** Each role accesses custom interfaces tracking spend velocity, active RFQs, and performance metrics, powered by responsive frontend caching.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 Multi-Role Unified Dashboards
Tailored interfaces with distinct page structures for **Admins**, **Procurement Officers**, **Managers**, and **Vendors**, aligning views to their specific permissions.

### 📋 Request for Quotation (RFQ) Pipeline
Create structural RFQs indicating line items (description, quantities, unit specs), set bidding deadlines, attach project documentation, and target specific vendor segments.

### ⚖️ Side-by-Side Quotation Analysis
Compare incoming vendor bids dynamically. Highlight minimum price bids, best delivery speeds, and highest vendor trust ratings in a clean, comparative grid interface.

### 🚦 Cryptographic Approval Chains
Draft Purchase Orders (POs) automatically once a quotation is accepted. Route approvals dynamically, allowing managers to sign off with explicit remarks and historical audit logs.

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics & Spend Distribution
Rich charts showing spend analytics by vendor categories, cost savings summaries, open RFQ metrics, and outstanding payments.

### 🔒 Enterprise-Grade RBAC
Strict role-based middleware guards every API controller and frontend view, verifying permission scopes (`rfq.*`, `purchase_order.approve`, etc.) dynamically.

---

## 🤖 Innovation & Intelligence

* 📈 **Dynamic Trust & Performance Scoring:** The platform tracks historical vendor deliverables, evaluating them on **Quality Score**, **Delivery Speed**, **Responsiveness**, and **User Rating**. High-risk vendors are automatically flagged, safeguarding enterprise resources.
* ⚡ **Frictionless Auto-Login Onboarding:** A modern, conversion-optimized signup flow. New users registering a workspace are automatically provisioned, marked active, signed in via session-based JWTs, and seamlessly redirected to their customizable onboarding setup wizard.

## 💾 Database Design Summary

Our PostgreSQL schema maps the complex procurement workflow through highly optimized models with relational constraints:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users ||--o{ user_roles : "has"
    roles ||--o{ user_roles : "assigned"
    roles ||--o{ role_permissions : "contains"
    permissions ||--o{ role_permissions : "granted"
    
    users ||--o{ rfqs : "creates"
    vendor_categories ||--o{ rfqs : "categorizes"
    rfqs ||--o{ rfq_items : "contains"
    rfqs ||--o{ rfq_vendors : "invites"
    
    vendors ||--o{ rfq_vendors : "receives"
    rfq_vendors ||--o{ quotations : "submits"
    quotations ||--o{ quotation_items : "contains"
    rfq_items ||--o{ quotation_items : "quoted_for"

    quotations ||--o{ purchase_orders : "referenced"
    vendors ||--o{ purchase_orders : "fulfills"
    purchase_orders ||--o{ purchase_order_items : "contains"
    
    purchase_orders ||--o{ invoices : "billing_for"
    vendors ||--o{ invoices : "sends"
    invoices ||--o{ invoice_items : "contains"
    
    users ||--o{ audit_logs : "triggers"
```

* **Relational Security:** Enforces cascade-delete on configuration joins while preventing delete operations on active transactional data (Purchase Orders, Invoices).
* **Indexing Strategy:** Composite indexes placed on foreign key relationships (`rfq_id`, `vendor_id`) and status fields to guarantee high-performance search queries.
* **Audit Integrity:** Relies on immutable `audit_logs` tracking structural modifications (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) showing old vs new JSON structures for absolute tracking.

---

## 🔒 Security & Defensive Features

* 🔐 **Next.js BFF Token Splitting:** Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by isolating API keys. Next.js App proxy abstracts Express tokens and saves them in secure, `httpOnly`, same-site cookies.
* 🛡️ **Salted Password Hashing:** User passwords are encrypted using `bcrypt` with `12` hashing rounds, locking them against dictionary attacks.
* 🚦 **Dynamic CORS Restrictions:** Whitelists frontend clients strictly, preventing cross-domain request forgery.
* ⏳ **API Rate Limiting:** Core authorization interfaces (login, signup, reset) are protected by rate limiters to prevent automated brute-force attacks.
* 💡 **Input Schema Sanitization:** Every API endpoint verifies inputs against strict structural schemas defined in `Zod`, rejecting structural injections.

---

## 🌐 Enterprise Scalability Design

* **Decoupled Monorepo Structure:** Frontend (Next.js Node engine) and Backend (Express runtime) operate independently, allowing developers to scale UI rendering separate from database query processing.
* **High Performance Caching:** Integrates `Redis` as a fast cache layer to store recurrent dashboard analytics and read-heavy statistics, offloading high-overhead PostgreSQL operations.
* **Standardized Environments:** Uses `Docker Compose` configurations to ensure development environment parity with production servers, easing continuous deployment pipelines.
